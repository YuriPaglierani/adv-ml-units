    "The nowadays popular and growing subfield of *Geometric Deep Learning* is concerned with the study of deep learning models explicitly designed to learn representations that are invariant/equivariant to certain transformations. Such goal is very often achieved thanks to a *deeper* understanding of the mathematical properties of data, representations, and how a given model is able to capture them."

Reading the paper is strongly recommended before starting this lab.\n",
